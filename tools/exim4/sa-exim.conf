# Options for spamassassin running in exim's local_scan (SA Exim)
# By Marc MERLIN <marc_soft@merlins.org> - Initial version: April 2002
# Sander Smeenk <ssmeenk@freshdot.net> - Improvements: March 2004
#
# Sample file version 1.16 for SA-Exim 4.1 - 2005/01/10 
#
# The parse routine is minimalistic. It expects "option: value" (exactly
# one space after the colon, and none before). You should put long lines
# on one line. The parser isn't capable of parsing multiline values.
#
# SA threshold values are parsed as floats and other numerical options
# are ints. String options have to be set. To unset them, comment out the
# variable, don't set it to nothing.
#
# READ THIS:
# ---------
# Watch your logs, you will get errors and your messages will get
# temporarily bounced if expansions fail. Watch your logs!
#
# If you are afraid that spammers might use a header that is used here
# as a default, have exim set it to another value than 'Yes' and check
# here for that other value.
#
# For every expansion, anything that doesn't expand to "" or "0"
# (without quotes) will be considered true. If you set the string to 1,
# it will be true without going through exim's condition evaluator (and
# if you leave it unset, it will default to 0)
#
# You should not put double quotes around expressions!
# --- snip ---

# Enable basic verbose output by default. Watch your logs!
SAEximDebug: 1


# Default path is /usr/bin/spamc, but you can change it here
SAspamcpath: /usr/bin/spamc

# Which characters are retained from a Message-Id header (for safety, we
# remove characters that might cause problems with shell parsing)
# Change the default at your own risk (you also have to change this in
# the SA greylisting patch if you use that)
#SAsafemesgidchars: !#%( )*+,-.0123456789:<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]^_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~

# If SAspamcSockPath is set spamc uses socket to connect to spamd,
# use --socketpath pathname as argument to spamd (new in SA 2.60).
# Leave it unset if you want spamc to connect(AF_INET) to spamd at
# 127.0.0.1 (this is the default shown in the options below), but if
# you set it, it will override the two TCP connect options below
#SAspamcSockPath: /var/run/spamd.sock

# SAspamcHost / SAspamcPort: TCP socket where your spamd is listening
# Shown below are the defaults:
SAspamcHost: 127.0.0.1
SAspamcPort: 783

# SAspamcUser: The username passed to spamc. Some tricks are needed to 
# decide on one user when there are many recipients. This string is of
# course expanded. If unset or empty, spamc will use the user Exim 
# runs as. We suggest that you decide what username to use in the ACLs
# and set an ACL variable.
#SAspamcUser: $acl_m2

# Exim configuration string to run before running SA against the message
# This decides whether SA gets run against the message or not.  This
# default will not reject messages if the message had SA headers but
# they weren't added by us.
SAEximRunCond: ${if and {{def:sender_host_address} {!eq {$sender_host_address}{127.0.0.1}} {!eq {$sender_host_address}{::1}}}}
# If you want more detailed control over when to run SA, it's recommended
# that you set an ACL variable indicating this from the acl section of
# your Exim configuration file. The current maintainer sets acl_m0 to 
# "noscan" if the sending host is localhost or has authenticated.
#SAEximRunCond: ${if !eq{$acl_m0}{noscan}}
# (This means exactly the same as ${if !eq{$acl_m0}{noscan} {true}{}}, 
# where the empty string is considered false.)

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Remove or comment out the following line to enable sa-exim
SAEximRunCond: 0
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

# If and only if SAEximRunCond was true, and we did run SA, this
# expression decides whether we actually consider acting upon SAdevnull,
# SApermreject, and SAtempreject if you have them set.
#
# Use this to tag messages that you shouldn't reject (messages sent to
# abuse or postmaster for instance).
#
# As an example, set acl_m0 to "canreject" if a recipient other than
# postmaster or abuse is encountered (and the sender isn't local). That
# way, spammers can't circumvent blocking by sending to postmaster and 
# 99 other recipients. (If acl_m0 is taken, you'll of course have to use
# a different variable.
#SAEximRejCond: ${if eq{$acl_m0}{canreject}}


# How much of the body we feed to spamassassin (in bytes)
# Default is 250KB
SAmaxbody: 256000

# Do you want to feed SAmaxbody's worth of the message body if it is too big?
# Either, you skip messages that are too big and not scan them, or you can
# truncate the body and feed that to SA.
# Note that SA will sometimes raise the spam score if it can't parse
# the message correctly (since the end is missing, decoding will fail)
# Default is 0: do not scan messages that are too big
# (note that this is parsed as a condition)
SATruncBodyCond: 0

# If you want SA to report_safe you need sa-exim to rewrite the body of
# the message since SA encapsulates the spam as a mime attachment.
# You probably want SATruncBodyCond to be 0 or else you'll end up with a
# partial message if it's larger than SAmaxbody and it's spam
#
# Also note that if you enable this option, any saved message will be saved
# after the body has been modified by SA.
# (this is not a condition as SA's report_safe is not conditional)
SARewriteBody: 0

# Prepend saved messages with an fake From-header to make the file look like a
# valid mbox file
SAPrependArchiveWithFrom: 1

# If you are archiving messages that are rejected, how much do you want
# to archive? Default is 20MB.
SAmaxarchivebody: 20971520

# On errors, if you are saving messages, you probably want the entire message
# Default size saved (if you are saving errors) is 1GB
SAerrmaxarchivebody: 1073741824

# You can have SA-Exim add a X-SA-Exim-Rcpt-To header, which will list all
# the recipients for the Email, unless the list gets bigger than 
# SAmaxrcptlistlength bytes.
# The default value of 0 disables the header for privacy reasons (the header
# exposes Bcced recipients)
# Any value bigger than 8000 will be ignored because there is a limit on the
# size of headers that you can have and exim's string_sprintf
# Note that if you are planning to use greylisting, you should set this
# value to 8000 since SA's greylisting code needs the recipients.
SAmaxrcptlistlength: 0

# Add X-SA-Exim-Rcpt-To and X-SA-Exim-Mail-From headers before SA scans
# the message.
# If this option is enabled, SARewiteBody is true, and safe_mode is
# enabled in SA, you end up with the X-SA-Exim-Rcpt-To/X-SA-Exim-Mail-From in
# the attatched message as well without the ability to remove them later in an
# exim transport (think privacy). 
# In real life this is usually not a problem because the message is spam anyway,
# and if you turn this off, you lose the option to use those headers to score
# the message with SA.
SAaddSAEheaderBeforeSA: 1

# How many seconds you want to allow spamc to run. Exim 4.04 and better will
# kill us after a default of 5 minutes. This however is not great, because the
# mail gets temporarily rejected
# You should set this and have SA Exim handle the timeout itself and accept the
# message if spamc takes too long (instead of timing out)
# A value of 0 means no timeout, and we run until exim stops us. 
# I know of at least one mail server (nanog's merit.edu) that will not
# wait a full 5mn (which causes tempreject and resends), so the default is 4mn

# NOTE: Spamd needs to tell sa-exim that the message SA-Exim gave spamd
# is spam before sa-exim will consider the SA tresholds.
# In other words, you cannot reject mails on SA scores if you set that
# threshold to a lower threshold than SA's required_hits value.
# The one exception to this rule is SAtempreject (in order to let you
# temporarily reject mail when you are doing greylisting, see
# README.greylisting in the documentation for details)

# Note that this is an obvious abuse of SMTP, but eh, they started it :-)
# Of course, this means that each incoming spam with the right score threshold
# will keep an exim process busy on your machine. Make sure you can afford it.
# Default value is 2^20, which should disable the behavior

# Please, don't teergrube people who relay for you or your own MXes :-)
# This option is left behind for backward compatibility, but you can now
# get the same result by putting a condition string in SAteergrube
# The trick is to list your score if the condition succeeds, and a really 
# high score otherwise.
